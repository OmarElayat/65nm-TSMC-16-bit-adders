## Overview
This project focuses on design exploration, analysis, and optimization of 16-bit adders architectures using 65nm technology. The objectives include detailed circuit design, and performance evaluation through functional and corner simulations. This study aims to enhance our understanding of full adder circuit behavior in modern semiconductor technology by investigating the impact of power-supply voltage on power-delay and energy-delay products.

## Introduction
This project explores and optimizes four 16-bit adder architecturesâ€”Ripple Carry Adder (RCA), Square Root Carry Select Adder (CSAsq), Carry Bypass Adder (CBA), and Kogge-Stone Adder (KSA) using 65nm technology. The selected architectures offer unique trade-offs in terms of speed, area, and power consumption. The primary objectives of this study encompass four key aspects. First, the project entails the detailed transistor-level design and optimizations of the 16-bit adder circuits. Subsequently, We set an objective function as a benchmark and the most optimized circuit is chosen and functionally verified against three test vectors that puts the adders in extreme propagate (P) and/or generate (G) conditions. The chosen adder delay/power/PDP/EDP vs power supply is also assessed. 

## Documentation Organization

The documentation is organized as follows: 

  1)  Chapter II describes in detail the design and optimization of the adders.
  2)  Chapter III discusses functional simulations.
  3)  Chapter IV discusses global mismatch simulations and power-supply sweep for the chosen adder.
  4)  Chapter V is the conclusion.
